# CNN_Image_Classification
Convolutional Neural Network model to classify (binary) images .
Python module is being used to built CNN model. Training set contains two folders cats and dogs corresponds to images of cats and dogs respectively. Similarly for test set. Convolutional Neural networks are best for image classification problems using core Artificial Neural Networks.
Step 0 - Import Libraries and Initialize CNN object
Step 1 - Convolution
Step 2 - Pooling
Step 3 - Flattening
Step 4 - Full Conncetion (i.e., bulinding ANN using Dense)
Step 5 - Data Augmentation (to avoid Over-fiting)
Step 6 - Fit and Predict data
