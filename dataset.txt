Picked dataset from below link - 
https://data-flair.training/blogs/cats-dogs-classification-deep-learning-project-beginners/
NOTE:
1. Ensure data is stored in the format 
      dataset -> training_set -> cats -> cats_images
      dataset -> training_set -> dogs -> dogs_images
      dataset -> test_set -> cats -> cats_images
      dataset -> test_set -> dogs -> dogs_images
2. Total number of training images (i.e. cats_img + dogs_img) need to be passed in correctly as 'samples_per_epoch' in .fit_generator function.
3. Total number of test images (i.e. cats_img + dogs_img) need to be passed in correctly as 'nb_val_samples' in .fit_generator function.
4. Folder for prediction of single image: prediction -> cat_or_dog.img
